Ubuntu Installation
xserver-xorg version 1.18.4 or newer is recommended to avoid potential performance issues with certain features in OBS, such as the fullscreen projector.

FFmpeg is required. If you do not have the FFmpeg installed (if you're not sure, then you probably don't have it), you can get it with the following commands:

For Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, FFmpeg is not officially included so you will need a specific PPA:

  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kirillshkrogalev/ffmpeg-next
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
For Ubuntu 15.04 and following versions, FFmpeg is officially included:

  sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
Then you can install OBS with the following commands, make sure you enabled the multiverse repo in Ubuntu's software center:

  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:obsproject/obs-studio
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install obs-studio
